That means we can add new branches and immediately see if the build passes/fails before merging the change that adds the build.\n* It takes advantage of the in-repo config to keep the config simple.  These jobs will only run on this branch; we will write similar configs on the other 2 branches but only list the jobs relevant to those branches.\n\nThe disadvantage is that we can\u0027t make one change to apply a new job to many\nrepos at once.\n",
