      "message": "Should these other items in the directory count towards the `size()` ([L192](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/websession-flatfile/+/refs/changes/83/475183/5/src/main/java/com/googlesource/gerrit/plugins/websession/flatfile/FlatFileWebSessionCache.java#192)) and should they be included when looking for items to cleanup (also uses `sessionStream()`)?\n\nIf not, then you should do the filtering up front. I think up front would be in both `getIfPresent()` and `sessionDirectoryStream()` (using [this form](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#newDirectoryStream(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.DirectoryStream.Filter)) of the `newDirectoryStream()` static method in the latter).\n\nSince I\u0027m a little confused about how you have this problem to begin with, I don\u0027t really know if these other cases are going to affect you as well.",
